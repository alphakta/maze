## <a name='story'>Story ü¶ä</a>

### Prelude

As a programming pragmatic module, you **CAN** use the programming language you want/love.<br />
The only thing is that you must provide a **Dockerfile** that run your project ;)
You **MUST** return a **Dockerfile**

### Algorithm

Your challenge is to have the best algorithm of your class ! <br />
I will check the execution time of your program, and you will get points according to your position :)

### Result

The algorithm solved via a command on the console (see in the **Rules** part), will be displayed in a file **map_resolve.map**.

## <a name='rules'> Rules üê±</a>

Hi, There are some conditions to respect in order to solve each map. There are 5 maps that are mazes. To solve each map, type this in the console :

* To resolv map 1, type : **time node .\src\main.js ./maps/rect_01.map** 
* To resolv map 2, type : **time node .\src\main.js ./maps/rect_02.map** 
* To resolv map 3, type : **time node .\src\main.js ./maps/rect_03.map** 
* To resolv map 4, type : **time node .\src\main.js ./maps/rect_04.map** 
* To resolv map 5, type : **time node .\src\main.js ./maps/rect_05.map**

## <a name='overview'>üê® Overview</a>

The purpose of this project is simple, you **MUST** create a binary or a script that take any textual map file that represent a labyrinth and you have to output the labyrinth with a trace of the labyrinth solution.
```sh
‚ùØ time ./maze.ts ./data/maps/rect.07.map

real   0m0,030s
user   0m0,020s
sys    0m0,012s
```

### Run with Docker
```sh
~/learn-algorithm/exams/maze/docker > docker compose up --build
...
```
